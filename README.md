## Analysis of real-time associations on Twitter


##### Description

Within this repository I have gathered the research I carried out in 2019 for my final MSc thesis at the University of Granada.

We perform a real-dataset generation by using Twitter API in order to extract those tweets related to specific political hashtag during July and August 2019. Our goal was to perform a study concept drift phenomena within this data in order to develop a model capable of monitoring political campaigns.

It is a multidisciplinary problem that could be interesting since it consider different Machine Learning fields, such as:

- Data Stream Mining
- Natural Language Processing
- Unsupervised Learning (Association Rules Learning)
- Social Media Mining

I have mainly worked with Python for Twitter data processing and I have leveraged other already-implemented methods for online rules analysis:
well as other methods for online rules analysis such as FuzzyCSar-AFP and MOA-IncMine.

- MOA-IncMine (https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~abifet/MOA-IncMine/)


##### Note

Data are not provided within this repo, but I am totally open to share it in case anybody is interested.
