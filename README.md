Within this repository I have gathered the research I carried out during 2018 for my final MSc thesis at the University of Granada.

Our goal was to study

It is a multidisciplinary problem that could be interesting since it consider different Machine Learning fields, such as:

- Data Stream Mining
- Natural Language Processing
- Unsupervised Learning: Association Rules Learning 
- Social Media Mining

I have mainly worked with Python for Twitter data processing and I have leveraged other already-implemented methods for online rules analysis:
well as other methods for online rules analysis such as FuzzyCSar-AFP and MOA-IncMine.
